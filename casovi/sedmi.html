                    Editing most Wikipedia pages is easy, just click the "Edit" tab at the top of a Wikipedia page (or on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Section">section-edit link</a>). This will take you to a new page with a text box<br> 
                    containing the editable text of the page you were viewing. In this box you can type in the text that you want to add using wiki markup to format the text and add other<br> 
                    elements like images and tables. If you don't want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext">learn the wiki markup</a> syntax, you can enable the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_editing_with_VisualEditor/1">VisualEditor</a> (but you must be a registered user), which allows you to <br>
                    edit pages in a user-friendly way. When you have finished editing you should write a short <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Edit_summary">edit summary</a> in the small field below the edit-box describing your changes.

                        contributors to the article and when their contribution was made. A more comprehensive history can be access in the "Page Statistics" which can be found in the External<br>
